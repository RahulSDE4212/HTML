<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- What it is: A short instruction for the web browser.
    What it does: It tells the browser “this is a modern HTML document” so the browser renders the page correctly. 
                  Think of it as telling the browser which rulebook to use. -->



<html lang="en">
<!--What it is: The opening tag for the whole HTML page. Everything on the page sits between <html> and </html>.
    What lang="en" does: Declares the page language as English. This helps search engines and assistive tools (like screen readers) behave correctly. 
    
    -- A search engine is a service that helps people find websites and content on the internet.
    -- It scans web pages, indexes the content, and then ranks results when someone searches.
    -- If your page says lang="en", the search engine knows the content is in English.
    -- This helps it show your page to people searching in English.
    -- It also prevents confusion if your page has multiple languages.

    -- Assistive tools are technologies that help people with disabilities use the web.
    -- Example: A screen reader reads web page text out loud for someone who is blind or has low vision. -->



<head>
<!-- What it is: A container for background information about the page (not visible to visitors as page content). 
     The browser reads this to learn things like the page title and how to display the page. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- What it is: A metadata line inside the head.
        What it does: Tells the browser how text characters are encoded (UTF-8 is the standard). 
        Without this, special characters might display as nonsense. Keep this — it’s essential. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- What it is: Another metadata line used for mobile devices.
        What it does: Makes sure the page scales properly on phones and tablets so text and layout look correct instead of tiny or zoomed out. -->
    <title>About me</title>
    <!-- What it is: The title of the page.
        What it does: Appears on the browser tab and is used when someone bookmarks or shares the page. 
        It’s also used by search engines. Short, clear titles are good. -->

</head> <!-- What it is: Closes the head section. After this, visible content begins. -->
